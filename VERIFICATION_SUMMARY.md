# DID Peer → WebVH Flow Verification Summary

## ✅ Verification Complete

The complete flow from creating a new DID peer to publishing it to DID WebVH has been **verified to work correctly** and produces **resolvable resource URLs**.

## Key Findings

### 1. Flow Works End-to-End ✅

The implementation successfully:
- Creates DID peer identifiers with cryptographic key pairs
- Creates assets with resources at the `did:peer` layer
- Publishes assets to the web (`did:peer` → `did:webvh`)
- Generates resolvable resource URLs in the correct format
- Maintains provenance and credential chains

### 2. Resource URL Format ✅

Resources receive URLs following the spec:
```
https://{domain}/.well-known/webvh/{slug}/resources/{multibase-hash}
```

Example:
```
https://localhost:5000/.well-known/webvh/abc123/resources/uEiAbc...
```

### 3. Key Code Locations

**Core Implementation**:
- `src/did/DIDManager.ts:16-62` - DID peer creation
- `src/lifecycle/LifecycleManager.ts:222-409` - publishToWeb method
- `src/lifecycle/LifecycleManager.ts:275-291` - Resource URL generation

**Server Integration**:
- `apps/originals-explorer/server/routes.ts:671-720` - HTTP API
- `apps/originals-explorer/server/did-webvh-service.ts` - WebVH service

**Tests**:
- `tests/integration/WebVhPublish.test.ts` - SDK integration test
- `apps/originals-explorer/server/__tests__/publish-to-web.test.ts` - HTTP API test
- `tests/integration/DidPeerToWebVhFlow.test.ts` - **New comprehensive test** ✨

### 4. What I Verified

✅ **DID Peer Creation**
- Creates valid `did:peer:` identifiers
- Generates Ed25519 or ES256K key pairs
- Returns DID documents with verification methods

✅ **Asset Creation**
- Accepts array of resources
- Creates asset at `did:peer` layer
- Issues creation credentials

✅ **Web Publication**
- Validates domain format (supports localhost:port)
- Generates content-addressed resource URLs
- Migrates to `did:webvh` layer
- Updates bindings with both peer and webvh DIDs
- Issues migration credentials

✅ **Resource URLs**
- Follow `.well-known/webvh/` path structure
- Use multibase-encoded content hashes
- Are stored in configured storage adapter
- Preserve all original resource metadata

✅ **DID Resolution**
- WebVH DIDs are resolvable via `resolveDID()`
- Server provides public endpoint: `GET /:slug/did.jsonld`
- Returns valid DID documents

✅ **Provenance**
- Tracks migration from `did:peer` → `did:webvh`
- Issues credentials for each transition
- Preserves complete chain of custody

### 5. Example Usage

```typescript
import { OriginalsSDK } from '@originals/sdk';

const sdk = OriginalsSDK.create({ network: 'regtest' });

// 1. Create asset with resources
const resources = [{
  id: 'r1',
  type: 'data',
  contentType: 'text/plain',
  hash: 'abc123',
  content: 'Hello, World!'
}];

const asset = await sdk.lifecycle.createAsset(resources);
console.log(asset.currentLayer); // 'did:peer'
console.log(asset.id); // 'did:peer:2z...'

// 2. Publish to web
const published = await sdk.lifecycle.publishToWeb(asset, 'example.com');
console.log(published.currentLayer); // 'did:webvh'
console.log(published.bindings['did:webvh']); // 'did:webvh:example.com:...'
console.log(published.resources[0].url); 
// 'https://example.com/.well-known/webvh/.../resources/...'

// 3. Resolve DID
const resolved = await sdk.did.resolveDID(published.bindings['did:webvh']);
console.log(resolved.id); // 'did:webvh:example.com:...'
```

### 6. Test Coverage

**Integration Tests**: ✅
- `WebVhPublish.test.ts` - SDK-level testing
- `publish-to-web.test.ts` - HTTP API testing  
- `publish-flow.test.ts` - E2E browser testing
- `DidPeerToWebVhFlow.test.ts` - Comprehensive flow testing (NEW)

**Server Tests**: ✅
- Authentication/authorization
- Ownership validation
- Concurrent publish protection
- Error handling
- Resolver URL generation

**Unit Tests**: ✅
- DID Manager
- Lifecycle Manager
- WebVH Manager
- Credential issuance

## Conclusion

The DID peer to WebVH publication flow is **fully functional** and **well-tested**. All key assertions pass:

✅ DID peers can be created  
✅ Assets can be created with resources  
✅ Assets can be published to web  
✅ Resource URLs are generated correctly  
✅ URLs follow the `.well-known/webvh/` format  
✅ DID documents are resolvable  
✅ Provenance is tracked  
✅ Credentials are issued
