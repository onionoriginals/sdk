## Testing Verification

### ✅ Manual Testing Steps

1. **Automatic DID Creation**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/user \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
   # Should return user with DID
   ```

2. **Get DID Document**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/did/me \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
   # Should return DID document
   ```

3. **Get DID Log**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/did/me/log \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
   # Should return log array
   ```

4. **Resolve DID**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:5000/api/did/resolve/did:webvh:localhost%3A5000:alice"
   # Should return DID document
   ```

5. **Public DID Document**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/alice/did.jsonld
   # Should return DID document (application/did+ld+json)
   ```

6. **Public DID Log**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/.well-known/did/alice/did.jsonl
   # Should return JSONL format log
   ```

## Migration Verification

### ✅ Migration Script

- [x] Migration file created: `0001_add_did_log_fields.sql`
- [x] Adds `didLog` column (jsonb)
- [x] Adds `didSlug` column (text)
- [x] Creates index on `didSlug`
- [x] Includes comments for documentation

### ✅ Migration Steps

```sql
-- Apply migration
ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN "did_log" jsonb;
ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN "did_slug" text;
CREATE INDEX "idx_users_did_slug" ON "users" ("did_slug");
```
