# DID Resolution Endpoint Update

## Summary

Updated the DID resolution endpoint to comply with the DID:WebVH specification for proper DID-to-HTTPS transformation.

## What Changed

### Before (Incorrect)
```
Endpoint: GET /.well-known/did/:userSlug
Example: http://localhost:5000/.well-known/did/cltest123456
```

### After (Correct - DID:WebVH Spec Compliant)
```
Endpoint: GET /:userSlug/did.jsonld
Example: http://localhost:5000/cltest123456/did.jsonld
```

## Why This Matters

According to the [DID:WebVH Specification](https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/v1.0/#the-did-to-https-transformation), DIDs are resolved using a **path-based transformation**, not the `.well-known` pattern.

### DID-to-HTTPS Transformation Rules

For a DID like: `did:webvh:example.com:user:alice`

1. Remove the `did:webvh:` prefix → `example.com:user:alice`
2. Split on colons: `["example.com", "user", "alice"]`
3. First part is domain → `example.com`
4. Rest are path segments → `/user/alice`
5. Append `/did.jsonld` → `/user/alice/did.jsonld`
6. Add HTTPS → `https://example.com/user/alice/did.jsonld`

### Our Implementation

For: `did:webvh:localhost:5000:cltest123456`

1. Domain: `localhost:5000`
2. Identifier: `cltest123456`
3. Resolves to: `http://localhost:5000/cltest123456/did.jsonld`

## Files Updated

### Backend
- ✅ `server/routes.ts` - Changed endpoint from `/.well-known/did/:userSlug` to `/:userSlug/did.jsonld`

### Documentation
- ✅ `DID_SETUP.md` - Updated all resolution examples
- ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated endpoint documentation
- ✅ `README_DID.md` - Updated quick start guide
- ✅ Created `DID_RESOLUTION_UPDATE.md` - This file

## Code Changes

### Route Definition (routes.ts)

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
app.get("/.well-known/did/:userSlug", async (req, res) => {
  // ... serve DID document
});

// AFTER (correct - spec compliant)
app.get("/:userSlug/did.jsonld", async (req, res) => {
  // ... serve DID document
});
```

### Comments Added

The route now includes proper documentation:

```typescript
// Serve DID document at path-based endpoint
// According to DID:WebVH spec: did:webvh:example.com:user:bob
// transforms to: https://example.com/user/bob/did.jsonld
// 
// For did:webvh:localhost:5000:user123
// Resolves to: http://localhost:5000/user123/did.jsonld
```

## Testing

### Test DID Resolution

```bash
# Create a DID by signing in and visiting profile

# Then resolve it:
curl http://localhost:5000/cltest123456/did.jsonld

# Should return:
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/multikey/v1"
  ],
  "id": "did:webvh:localhost:5000:cltest123456",
  "verificationMethod": [...],
  ...
}
```

### Content-Type Header

The response still includes the proper content type:
```
Content-Type: application/did+ld+json
```

## Specification Reference

From the DID:WebVH spec:

> The DID-to-HTTPS transformation for did:webvh uses the following algorithm:
> 
> 1. Remove the `did:webvh:` prefix from the DID
> 2. Split the remaining string on `:` characters
> 3. The first element is the domain name
> 4. The remaining elements form the path
> 5. Append `/did.jsonld` to the path
> 6. Construct the HTTPS URL

## Impact

### ✅ Positive
- Now compliant with DID:WebVH specification
- Works with standard DID resolvers
- Proper path-based routing
- Better for SEO and URL structure

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- Old `.well-known/did/:slug` endpoint no longer works
- If you had DIDs created with the old endpoint pattern, they will need to be updated
- Documentation updated to reflect new pattern

## Migration Guide

If you already created DIDs with the old endpoint:

1. **DIDs themselves are unchanged** - The DID identifiers (`did:webvh:...`) remain the same
2. **Only the resolution endpoint changed** - Update any code that resolves DIDs
3. **Update bookmarks/links** - Change `/.well-known/did/slug` to `/slug/did.jsonld`

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Endpoint updated to `/:userSlug/did.jsonld`
- [x] Comments added explaining spec compliance
- [x] All documentation updated
- [x] Examples updated in all docs
- [x] Proper content-type header maintained
- [x] Route handler logic unchanged (just path)
