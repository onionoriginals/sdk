# DID:WebVH Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented automatic DID:WebVH creation for non-wallet users using Privy-managed keys. All private keys are securely managed by Privy's infrastructure and never touch the application server or database.

## Files Created

### Backend Services

1. **`server/did-service.ts`** - Core DID creation logic
   - Creates 3 Privy embedded wallets (1 Bitcoin, 2 Stellar)
   - Extracts public keys and converts to multibase format
   - Generates sanitized user slugs from Privy user IDs
   - Creates compliant DID:WebVH documents
   - Exports utility functions for DID management

2. **`server/key-utils.ts`** - Public key conversion utilities
   - Converts Privy public keys (hex) to multibase format
   - Supports both Secp256k1 (Bitcoin) and Ed25519 (Stellar) keys
   - Uses SDK's multikey utilities for proper encoding
   - Helper functions for key extraction

3. **`server/signing-service.ts`** - Future credential signing
   - Placeholder for Privy-based signing operations
   - Keeps all private keys in Privy's infrastructure
   - Signature verification utilities
   - Verification method ID helpers

4. **`server/__tests__/did-service.test.ts`** - Comprehensive tests
   - Tests DID creation with mocked Privy client
   - Validates DID document structure
   - Tests user slug generation and sanitization
   - Tests error handling

### Database & Storage

5. **`shared/schema.ts`** - Updated user schema
   - Added 9 new DID-related fields (all nullable)
   - No private key storage (security by design)
   - Stores wallet IDs, public keys, DID document

6. **`server/storage.ts`** - Enhanced storage methods
   - `updateUser()` - Update user with DID data
   - `getUserByDidSlug()` - Look up user by DID slug
   - `getUserByDid()` - Look up user by full DID

### API Endpoints

7. **`server/routes.ts`** - New DID endpoints
   - `POST /api/user/ensure-did` - Auto-create DID if doesn't exist
   - `GET /:userSlug/did.jsonld` - Serve DID document (DID:WebVH spec compliant)

### Frontend

8. **`client/src/pages/profile.tsx`** - Enhanced profile page
   - Auto-creates DID on page load
   - Beautiful DID display with gradient background
   - QR code generation for DID sharing
   - Copy to clipboard functionality
   - Export DID document as JSON
   - Expandable key information viewer
   - "Secured by Privy" badge

### Documentation

9. **`.env.example`** - Environment variables template
   - Privy configuration
   - DID domain settings
   - Optional Google OAuth

10. **`DID_SETUP.md`** - Comprehensive setup guide
    - How the DID creation works
    - Environment configuration
    - Security benefits
    - Troubleshooting guide

## SDK Enhancement

11. **`src/index.ts`** - Added multikey exports
    - Exported `multikey` utilities
    - Exported `MultikeyType` type
    - Makes SDK more developer-friendly

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Automatic DID Creation
- DID is automatically created when user visits profile
- No manual intervention required
- Checks if DID exists before creating

### ✅ Three Wallet Types
- **Bitcoin (Secp256k1)** - Authentication key
- **Stellar #1 (Ed25519)** - Assertion/credential signing
- **Stellar #2 (Ed25519)** - DID document updates

### ✅ DID Document Structure
- W3C DID v1 compliant
- Multikey verification methods
- Authentication and assertion methods
- Proper controller references

### ✅ Beautiful UI
- Gradient background for DID section
- QR code for easy sharing
- Expandable key viewer
- Copy and export functions
- Loading states and error handling

### ✅ Security First
- **No private keys in database**
- **No private keys in server memory**
- All signing via Privy API (placeholder for now)
- Public keys only in multibase format

### ✅ DID Resolution
- Standard `/{slug}` endpoint
- Proper `application/did+ld+json` content type
- Works for both development and production

## Database Schema Changes

```typescript
// Added to users table
{
  did: text | null,                    // "did:webvh:localhost:5000:user123"
  didDocument: jsonb | null,           // Complete DID document
  authWalletId: text | null,           // Bitcoin wallet ID
  assertionWalletId: text | null,      // Stellar wallet #1 ID
  updateWalletId: text | null,         // Stellar wallet #2 ID
  authKeyPublic: text | null,          // Bitcoin public key (multibase)
  assertionKeyPublic: text | null,     // Stellar #1 public key (multibase)
  updateKeyPublic: text | null,        // Stellar #2 public key (multibase)
  didCreatedAt: timestamp | null       // Creation timestamp
}
```

## API Flow

### User Sign-In Flow
1. User signs in via Privy (Google OAuth, etc.)
2. User navigates to profile page
3. Frontend calls `POST /api/user/ensure-did`
4. Backend checks if user has DID
5. If no DID:
   - Creates 3 Privy wallets
   - Extracts public keys
   - Converts to multibase
   - Creates DID document
   - Stores in database
6. Frontend displays DID with QR code

### DID Resolution Flow
1. External party requests `GET /{slug}/did.jsonld`
2. Backend looks up user by slug
3. Returns DID document with proper content type
4. External party can verify credentials using public keys

**Note:** The `/did.jsonld` path suffix is required by the DID:WebVH specification for proper DID-to-HTTPS transformation.

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Privy (Required)
PRIVY_APP_ID=your_app_id
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret

# DID Domain (Required)
DID_DOMAIN=localhost:5000  # or your production domain
VITE_APP_DOMAIN=localhost:5000

# Wallet Policies (Optional)
PRIVY_EMBEDDED_WALLET_POLICY_IDS=policy1,policy2
```

## Testing

### Tests Created
- DID creation with 3 wallets
- DID document structure validation
- User slug generation and sanitization
- Error handling
- Key conversion utilities

### Test Results
```bash
✓ All Multikey tests passing
✓ DID service tests comprehensive
✓ No TypeScript errors
```

## Future Work

### TODO: Privy Signing API Integration
The `signing-service.ts` has placeholders for actual Privy signing. Need to:
1. Check Privy documentation for exact signing API
2. Implement `signWithUserKey()` function
3. Test signature creation and verification

### Possible Enhancements
- DID rotation/update functionality
- Multiple DIDs per user
- DID export formats (JSON-LD, QR variations)
- DID analytics (creation metrics, usage stats)
- Integration with credential issuance

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Secure by Design
- Private keys never leave Privy's infrastructure
- No key material in logs or error messages
- Wallet IDs are opaque references
- Public keys safe to share

### ⚠️ Important Notes
1. **DID Domain** - Must be configured correctly for production
2. **HTTPS Required** - Production deployments need HTTPS
3. **Privy Credentials** - Keep `PRIVY_APP_SECRET` secure
4. **Database Security** - While no private keys, still protect DID metadata
