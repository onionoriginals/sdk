## Key Features

### Backend API

#### 1. List Files Endpoint (`POST /api/google-drive/list-folder`)
- Lists all files in a Google Drive folder
- Supports root folder or specific folder ID
- Returns file metadata including:
  - Name, MIME type, size
  - Thumbnails and preview links
  - Creation/modification dates

#### 2. Import Folder Endpoint (`POST /api/google-drive/import-folder`)
- Imports files from Google Drive
- Creates did:peer assets using Originals SDK
- Handles large files and Google Docs specially
- Stores full metadata and provenance
- Returns detailed results with success/failure counts

### Frontend UI

#### Import Page Features
- Google OAuth token input
- Folder ID selection (optional)
- File listing with thumbnails
- Multi-select functionality
- Category selection
- Import progress tracking
- Detailed error reporting
- Success summary with stats

### Asset Creation

Each imported file creates a complete asset with:
- **Title**: Original filename
- **Description**: "Imported from Google Drive"
- **Category**: User-selected (art, music, video, document, etc.)
- **Tags**: `["google-drive", "imported"]`
- **Layer**: `did:peer`
- **DID Document**: Complete did:peer identifier
- **Credentials**: Verifiable credentials from SDK
- **Provenance**: Full provenance chain
- **Metadata**: Google Drive file information

## Security Features

1. **Token Management**
   - Access tokens never stored on server
   - Users provide their own OAuth tokens
   - Tokens stored in browser localStorage only

2. **File Size Limits**
   - 10MB limit on downloaded files
   - Prevents DoS attacks
   - Large files stored as references

3. **Authentication**
   - All endpoints require user authentication
   - Assets owned by importing user
   - Cannot access other users' imports

4. **Input Validation**
   - File type validation
   - Folder ID validation
   - Safe error handling

## Technical Implementation

### File Handling Strategy

1. **Small Files (<10MB)**
   - Downloaded completely
   - Content hashed (SHA-256)
   - Stored in asset metadata

2. **Large Files (>10MB) or Google Docs**
   - Stored as reference URLs
   - Metadata includes webViewLink
   - Thumbnail links preserved

### did:peer Creation

Each file creates a unique did:peer using:
```typescript
const resources = [{
  id: `resource-${Date.now()}-${fileId}`,
  type: 'AssetMetadata',
  contentType: 'application/json',
  hash: metadataHash,
  content: metadataString,
  url: mediaUrl || undefined,
}];

const originalsAsset = await originalsSdk.lifecycle.createAsset(resources);
```

## Navigation & Access

The feature is accessible from:
1. **Header**: "Import Drive" link (desktop and mobile)
2. **Dashboard**: "Import from Drive" button in quick actions
3. **Direct URL**: `/import-google-drive`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test Google Drive API calls
   - Test file listing logic
   - Test import logic
   - Test error handling

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test full import flow
   - Test authentication flow
   - Test asset creation
   - Test database storage

3. **E2E Tests**
   - Test UI navigation
   - Test file selection
   - Test import process
   - Test success/error states

## Future Enhancements

See `GOOGLE_DRIVE_IMPORT.md` for a complete list of potential improvements, including:
- OAuth flow integration
- Batch import with progress
- Folder structure preservation
- Automatic token refresh
- Shared drives support

## Dependencies

### Required
- `googleapis@^144.0.0` - Google Drive API client
- `google-auth-library@^10.2.1` - Already installed
- `@originals/sdk` - Asset and DID creation

### Environment Variables
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret
- `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` - OAuth redirect URI (optional)

## Conclusion

The Google Drive import feature is fully implemented and integrated into the Originals Explorer application. Users can now easily import files from their Google Drive and create did:peer assets with full provenance tracking and verifiable credentials.

All code follows existing patterns in the codebase, uses proper error handling, and includes comprehensive security measures.
