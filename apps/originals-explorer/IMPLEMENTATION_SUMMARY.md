# Spreadsheet Asset Upload Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive spreadsheet upload feature that allows users to bulk create assets with automatic `did:peer` identifier generation.

## Implementation Date
2025-10-02

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`shared/schema.ts`)
- Added `assetTypes` table with fields:
  - `id`, `userId`, `name`, `description`, `properties`
  - Timestamps: `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- Created `insertAssetTypeSchema` for validation
- Added TypeScript types: `AssetType`, `InsertAssetType`

### 2. Storage Layer (`server/storage.ts`)
Extended `IStorage` interface and `MemStorage` implementation:
- `getAssetType(id)` - Retrieve single asset type
- `getAssetTypesByUserId(userId)` - Get all user's asset types
- `createAssetType(assetType)` - Create new asset type
- `updateAssetType(id, updates)` - Update existing asset type

### 3. Backend API Routes (`server/routes.ts`)

#### Asset Type Endpoints
- **GET** `/api/asset-types` - Get user's asset types
- **POST** `/api/asset-types` - Create new asset type

#### Spreadsheet Upload Endpoint
- **POST** `/api/assets/upload-spreadsheet`
- Features:
  - File validation (CSV/XLSX, 10MB max)
  - Multer middleware for file handling
  - Spreadsheet parsing (csv-parse, xlsx libraries)
  - Row-by-row validation
  - did:peer creation for each asset via Originals SDK
  - Automatic asset type creation
  - Detailed error reporting
  - Partial success support

### 4. Frontend Components

#### Upload Assets Page (`client/src/pages/upload-assets.tsx`)
Features:
- Drag & drop file upload interface
- File type validation
- CSV preview (first 5 rows)
- Upload progress indicator
- Results display with success/error breakdown
- Error details table with row numbers
- Navigation to assets page after upload

UI Components Used:
- Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription
- Button, Progress, Alert, Table
- lucide-react icons: Upload, FileSpreadsheet, CheckCircle, XCircle, AlertCircle

### 5. Routing Updates (`client/src/App.tsx`)
- Added `/upload-assets` route
- Imported and registered `UploadAssets` component

### 6. Navigation Updates

#### Dashboard (`client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`)
- Added "Upload Spreadsheet" button
- Positioned between "Create Asset" and "Migrate Ordinal"
- Uses FileSpreadsheet icon

#### Assets Page (`client/src/pages/assets-spreadsheet.tsx`)
- Added "Upload Spreadsheet" button in header
- Quick access to upload functionality

### 7. Dependencies Added (`package.json`)
Runtime dependencies:
- `multer@^1.4.5-lts.1` - File upload handling
- `csv-parse@^5.5.6` - CSV parsing
- `xlsx@^0.18.5` - Excel file parsing

Dev dependencies:
- `@types/multer@^1.4.12` - TypeScript types for multer

## Key Features

### did:peer Integration
Each uploaded asset automatically receives:
- Unique decentralized identifier
- DID document with verification methods
- Cryptographic hash of asset content
- Resource metadata structure

Implementation in `routes.ts`:
```typescript
const resources = [{
  id: `asset-${Date.now()}-${i}`,
  type: 'AssetMetadata',
  contentType: 'application/json',
  hash: assetHash,
  content: assetContent,
}];

const originalsAsset = await originalsSdk.createAsset(resources);
```

### Asset Type Auto-Creation
- Automatically creates asset types from spreadsheet data
- Extracts custom properties from non-standard columns
- Stores property definitions for reuse
- Links to user account

### Error Handling
- Row-level error tracking
- Partial success processing
- Detailed error messages with row numbers
- Graceful degradation if DID creation fails

### Data Validation
- Required field checking (title, assetType, category)
- File type and size validation
- Schema validation via Zod
- MIME type checking

## Spreadsheet Format

### Required Columns
- `title` - Asset name/title
- `assetType` - Type classification
- `category` - Category (art, music, collectible, etc.)

### Optional Columns
- `description` - Detailed description
- `tags` - Comma-separated tags
- `mediaUrl` - URL to media file
- `status` - draft/pending/completed

### Custom Properties
Any additional columns are stored as custom properties:
- `serialNumber`, `manufacturer`, `yearProduced`, etc.
- Automatically extracted and stored
- Become part of asset type definition

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- ✅ Authentication required (Privy JWT tokens)
- ✅ File size limits (10MB)
- ✅ File type validation
- ✅ User ID validation
- ✅ Zod schema validation
- ✅ Error sanitization

### Recommended for Production
- Rate limiting on upload endpoint
- Virus scanning for uploaded files
- Content Security Policy headers
- Input sanitization for CSV data
- Row count limits
- Database transaction support

## Testing Artifacts

### Sample Data (`sample-assets.csv`)
Includes 5 sample assets demonstrating:
- Required fields
- Optional fields
- Custom properties
- Various asset types
- Different categories

### Documentation (`SPREADSHEET_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`)
Comprehensive user guide covering:
- Required/optional columns
- Custom properties
- Upload process
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting
- Technical details

## Migration Notes

### From localStorage to Database
Previously, asset types were stored in browser localStorage. New implementation:
- Server-side storage in database
- User account association
- Better persistence and reliability
- Enables bulk operations
- Supports multi-device access

Existing users should recreate asset types through the Setup page.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Column Mapping Interface**
   - Visual mapper for flexible spreadsheet formats
   - Save mapping templates
   - Support for non-standard column names

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Queue large uploads
   - Background processing
   - Progress webhooks

3. **Enhanced DID Features**
   - Bulk publish to did:webvh
   - Batch Bitcoin inscription
   - Automatic credential issuance

4. **Validation Features**
   - Pre-upload validation
   - Data type detection
   - Duplicate detection
   - Reference checking

5. **Export Features**
   - Export created assets to CSV
   - Export with DID information
   - Template generation

6. **UI Enhancements**
   - Cell-level editing in preview
   - Inline error correction
   - Drag-to-reorder columns
   - Column hiding/showing

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Sequential processing (one row at a time)
- In-memory storage
- Synchronous DID creation

### Optimization Opportunities
- Parallel asset creation (Promise.all with concurrency limit)
- Streaming CSV parsing for large files
- Database batch inserts
- Background job queue for large uploads
- Caching for asset type lookups

## API Response Format

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "created": 5,
  "failed": 0,
  "assets": [...],
  "errors": undefined
}
```

### Partial Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "created": 3,
  "failed": 2,
  "assets": [...],
  "errors": [
    { "row": 2, "error": "Missing required field: title" },
    { "row": 5, "error": "Invalid category value" }
  ]
}
```
