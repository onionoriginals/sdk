## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Start with Task 1.1
It's well-defined, has no dependencies, and teaches you the entire process.

### 2. Use the Exact Prompts
They're battle-tested and include all requirements. Don't freelance.

### 3. Validate Early and Often
Run tests after every significant change. Catch issues early.

### 4. Provide Good Context
Give AI agents the right files. See each task's "Context Files to Provide" section.

### 5. Document As You Go
Don't wait. Document while implementing.

### 6. Parallel When Possible
Tasks without dependencies can run in parallel. Check the dependency graph.

### 7. Integration Test Between Phases
Don't wait until the end. Test integration after each phase.

### 8. Celebrate Milestones
Completed a task? üéâ Completed a phase? üèÜ Stay motivated!

## üö® Common Pitfalls

### ‚ùå Not Reading Documentation
- **Problem**: Confused about requirements
- **Solution**: Read the guides first

### ‚ùå Skipping Tests
- **Problem**: Broken code merged
- **Solution**: Write tests first or alongside code

### ‚ùå Not Providing Context
- **Problem**: AI agent doesn't understand existing code
- **Solution**: Provide the specific context files listed

### ‚ùå Ignoring Dependencies
- **Problem**: Build Task 2.1 before Task 1.1
- **Solution**: Follow the dependency graph

### ‚ùå No Validation
- **Problem**: Broken code not caught until later
- **Solution**: Run validation commands frequently
