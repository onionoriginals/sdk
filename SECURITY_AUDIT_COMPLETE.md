## 🔍 Key Security Findings

### Critical Issues: 0 ✅

**No critical vulnerabilities found** - system is fundamentally secure.

### Medium Priority Issues: 4 ⚠️

1. **Fee Rate Validation** - Needs upper bounds
   - **Impact:** Potential fund drainage
   - **Fix:** Add `MAX_REASONABLE_FEE_RATE = 10,000 sat/vB`
   - **Priority:** HIGH

2. **Race Conditions** - Concurrent batch operations
   - **Impact:** UTXO double-selection potential
   - **Fix:** Implement UTXO locking mechanism
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM

3. **Timeout Handling** - Partial state after timeout
   - **Impact:** Orphaned pending transactions
   - **Fix:** Track operations after timeout
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM

4. **UTXO Lock Checking** - Inconsistent implementation
   - **Impact:** Attempting to spend locked UTXOs
   - **Fix:** Standardize across selection functions
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM

### Low Priority Issues: 3 ℹ️

5. Integer overflow in large batch calculations
6. Domain validation could be stricter
7. JSONB size constraints missing

## ✨ Security Strengths Identified

The codebase demonstrates **excellent security practices**:

✅ **Input Validation**
- Bitcoin address validation with checksum verification
- Satoshi number range checking (0 to 21M BTC)
- MIME type validation with regex

✅ **Cryptography**
- Uses audited libraries (@noble/secp256k1, @noble/ed25519)
- No custom crypto implementation
- Proper multikey encoding

✅ **Error Handling**
- Structured errors with codes
- No sensitive data leakage
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks

✅ **Transaction Safety**
- Idempotent broadcasting
- Dust limit handling (546 sats)
- Minimum relay fee enforcement (1.1 sat/vB)

✅ **Batch Processing**
- Pre-validation before execution
- Fail-fast and continue-on-error modes
- Retry with exponential backoff

## 🛠️ Recommendations for Production

### Before Deployment (Required) ⚠️

1. **Implement fee rate upper bounds**
   ```typescript
   // Add to BitcoinManager.ts
   const MAX_REASONABLE_FEE_RATE = 10_000;
   if (feeRate > MAX_REASONABLE_FEE_RATE) {
     throw new StructuredError('INVALID_INPUT',
       `Fee rate ${feeRate} exceeds maximum ${MAX_REASONABLE_FEE_RATE}`);
   }
   ```

2. **Add UTXO locking for concurrent batches**
   ```typescript
   // Add to LifecycleManager.ts
   private utxoLocks = new Map<string, Promise<any>>();
   ```

3. **Improve timeout handling**
   - Track pending operations
   - Provide status callbacks

### After Deployment (Recommended) 📅

4. Standardize UTXO lock checking
5. Add monitoring/telemetry for batch operations
6. Document retry behavior
