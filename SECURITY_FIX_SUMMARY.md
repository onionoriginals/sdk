# Security Fix & Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Security Fix: Path Traversal Prevention ✅

**Issue**: Directory traversal vulnerability in `saveDIDLog()` method
- User-supplied path segments were not validated before being used in file operations
- Could allow writing files outside the intended directory

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `isValidPathSegment()` private method to validate all path segments
- Rejects segments containing:
  - `.` or `..` (directory traversal)
  - Path separators (`/`, `\`)
  - Null bytes (`\0`)
  - Absolute paths
  - Empty segments
- Added defense-in-depth check to verify resolved path stays within base directory

**Location**: `src/did/WebVHManager.ts` lines 202-224, 240-252, 261-266

### 2. Code Cleanup ✅

**Removed Files**:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - 281 lines
- `WEBVH_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - 201 lines  
- `docs/DID_WEBVH_GUIDE.md` - 309 lines
- `src/examples/webvh-demo.ts` - 99 lines
- `verify-webvh.mjs` - 163 lines

**Removed Unused Variables**:
- `publicKeyBytes` in `createDIDWebVH()` - decoded but never used
- `domainPart` in `saveDIDLog()` - extracted but never used

**Total Removed**: 1,060 lines of documentation and demo code

### 3. Test Coverage Enhancement ✅

**Added Tests** (194 new lines):

**Security Tests**:
- Path traversal with `..` 
- Path traversal with `.`
- Path separators in segments (`/`)
- Backslashes in segments (`\`)
- Null bytes in segments
- Absolute Unix paths (`/etc/passwd`)
- Absolute Windows paths (`C:\Windows\System32`)
- Empty path segments
- Valid alphanumeric segments
- Valid segments with hyphens and underscores

**Error Handling Tests**:
- Invalid DID format (missing parts)
- Non-webvh DID method
- DID without path parts
- URL-encoded domain handling
- Empty path segments
- Path escaping base directory

**Coverage Target**: 100% line coverage for `WebVHManager.ts`

## Summary

- **Security**: Fixed critical path traversal vulnerability (P1 priority)
- **Cleanup**: Removed 1,060 lines of documentation/demo code
- **Testing**: Added 194 lines of comprehensive security and edge case tests
- **Code Quality**: Removed unused variables, improved code clarity
