## üí¨ Example Flow

**User:** "@questions Fix the button alignment"

**AI Response:**
```
Before making changes, I need to clarify:

1. **Scope:** Fix just this button or review all buttons for consistency?
2. **Approach:** Use CSS Grid, Flexbox, or adjust existing positioning?
3. **Testing:** How to verify across screen sizes and browsers?

Once you confirm, I'll implement according to your preferences.
```
