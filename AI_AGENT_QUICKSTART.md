# AI Agent Build - Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Start Here

This guide gets you executing AI agents on the Originals SDK asset layer build in **under 10 minutes**.

---

## Prerequisites (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone <repo-url>
cd originals-sdk
bun install

# 2. Verify everything works
bun test
bun run type-check

# 3. Create tracking project (GitHub)
# Go to: https://github.com/your-org/originals-sdk/projects
# Create project: "Asset Layer Enhancements"
```

---

## Pick Your Orchestration Method

### Method 1: Manual Agent Coordination (Recommended for Start)

Best for: Learning, small teams, testing the process

**Step 1**: Choose first task
```bash
# Start with Phase 1, Task 1.1 (Event System)
# It has no dependencies and is foundational
```

**Step 2**: Create branch
```bash
git checkout -b phase-1/task-1.1-event-system
```

**Step 3**: Copy exact prompt from AI_AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md
```
See: AI_AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md â†’ Task 1.1 â†’ "Exact Prompt"
```

**Step 4**: Provide context to AI agent
```
Give agent these files to read:
- src/lifecycle/OriginalsAsset.ts
- src/lifecycle/LifecycleManager.ts
- src/core/OriginalsSDK.ts
- tests/integration/CompleteLifecycle.e2e.test.ts
```

**Step 5**: Give agent the prompt and let it work

**Step 6**: Validate results
```bash
bun test tests/unit/events/
bun test tests/integration/Events.test.ts
bun run type-check
```

**Step 7**: Create PR
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement event system"
git push origin phase-1/task-1.1-event-system
# Create PR on GitHub
```

**Step 8**: Move to next task!

---

### Method 2: Parallel Agent Execution

Best for: Speed, multiple AI accounts/sessions, experienced teams

**Setup** (one time):
```bash
# Create all branches
./scripts/create-branches.sh

# Create GitHub issues for all tasks
./scripts/create-issues.sh
```

**Execute**:
```
Open 3-5 AI chat sessions (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

Session 1: Task 1.1 (Event System)
Session 2: Task 1.2 (Validation Framework)
Session 3: Task 1.3 (Logging)

Give each session:
1. Its specific prompt from AI_AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md
2. The required context files
3. Let them work in parallel
```

**Coordinate**:
```
Check in every 2-4 hours
Merge completed tasks
Resolve any conflicts
Move to next phase when phase complete
```

---

### Method 3: Automated Pipeline (Advanced)

Best for: Large teams, production deployment, CI/CD integration

**Setup**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai-agent-pipeline.yml
name: AI Agent Build Pipeline

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      task:
        description: 'Task to execute (e.g., 1.1)'
        required: true
      
jobs:
  execute-task:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      
      - name: Run AI Agent
        run: |
          # Call AI API with task prompt
          # Validate output
          # Create PR
```

---

## Your First Agent: Event System

### Complete Walkthrough (30 minutes)

**1. Setup (2 min)**
```bash
git checkout -b phase-1/task-1.1-event-system
```

**2. Read context files (5 min)**
```bash
# Have the AI agent read these files:
cat src/lifecycle/OriginalsAsset.ts
cat src/lifecycle/LifecycleManager.ts
cat src/core/OriginalsSDK.ts
```

**3. Give AI this prompt (1 min)**
```
You are implementing an event system for the Originals SDK asset layer.

OBJECTIVE:
Create a type-safe, performant event system that emits events during all asset lifecycle operations.

FULL REQUIREMENTS:
See AI_AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md â†’ Task 1.1 for complete requirements.

Key requirements summary:
1. Create EventEmitter class in src/events/EventEmitter.ts
2. Define event types in src/events/types.ts
3. Integrate into OriginalsAsset (emit in migrate, recordTransfer)
4. Integrate into LifecycleManager (emit in all operations)
5. Write comprehensive tests
6. Document in EVENTS.md

CONSTRAINTS:
- Event emission overhead must be <1ms
- Type-safe event definitions
- Error isolation for handlers
- Backward compatible (no breaking changes)

Start implementing now. Show me your approach first, then implement.
```

**4. Agent works (15 min)**
```
Agent will:
- Design event system
- Implement EventEmitter
- Define event types
- Integrate into existing code
- Write tests
- Create documentation
```

**5. Validate (5 min)**
```bash
# Run tests
bun test tests/unit/events/
bun test tests/integration/Events.test.ts

# Check types
bun run type-check

# Check linting
bun run lint

# Verify documentation
cat EVENTS.md
```

**6. Create PR (2 min)**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement event system for asset lifecycle

- Add EventEmitter class with type-safe events
- Define event types for all lifecycle operations
- Integrate events into OriginalsAsset and LifecycleManager
- Add comprehensive tests (unit + integration)
- Document event system in EVENTS.md

Closes #1"

git push origin phase-1/task-1.1-event-system
```

**7. Success! ðŸŽ‰**

## Task Priority Order

Execute in this order for best results:

### Week 1: Foundation
```
Day 1-2: Task 1.1 (Event System) - Required by others
Day 2-3: Task 1.2 (Validation) - Required by others  
Day 4-5: Task 1.3 (Logging) - Depends on 1.1
```

### Week 2: Foundation Complete
```
Day 1: Integration testing for Phase 1
Day 2-5: Start Phase 2 (parallel tasks)
```

### Week 3-4: Core Features
```
Task 2.1: Batch Operations (HIGH VALUE)
Task 2.2: Resource Versioning
Task 2.3: Provenance Query
```

### Week 5-6: Security
```
Task 3.1: Key Rotation (CRITICAL)
Task 3.2: Fake Asset Detection
Task 3.3: Front-Running Protection
```

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

### "Tests are failing"
```bash
# Get detailed output
bun test --reporter=verbose

# Run specific test
bun test tests/unit/events/EventEmitter.test.ts

# Check for TypeScript errors
bun run type-check

# Provide test output to agent and ask for fix
```

### "Type errors"
```bash
# See all errors
bun run type-check

# Common issues:
# - Missing type imports
# - Incorrect interface implementation
# - Missing required properties

# Show errors to agent with context
```

### "Integration conflicts"
```bash
# Pull latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Rebase your branch
git checkout phase-1/task-1.1-event-system
git rebase main

# Resolve conflicts
# Run tests again
```

### "Agent is confused"
```
Try this:
1. Provide more context files
2. Show existing similar code
3. Give more specific requirements
4. Break task into smaller steps
5. Show test examples
```

## Example Prompts for Common Situations

### When Agent Needs More Context

```
To complete this task, you need to understand how [component] works.

Here's the current implementation:

[Paste relevant code]

Key points:
1. [Explain important aspect]
2. [Explain another aspect]

Now continue with the task, ensuring your implementation:
- Follows the same patterns
- Integrates smoothly
- Doesn't break existing behavior
```

### When Agent Needs Direction

```
Good progress! For the next step, focus on:

1. [Specific next step]
2. [What to implement]
3. [What to test]

Example of what I'm looking for:

[Provide code example or pseudocode]

Continue implementation.
```

### When Tests Fail

```
Tests are failing. Here's the output:

[Paste test output]

The issue is: [Explain what you think is wrong]

Please:
1. Analyze the failure
2. Identify root cause
3. Fix the implementation
4. Verify tests pass
5. Explain what was wrong

Provide the fixed code.
```

### When Performance is Poor

```
Implementation works but is too slow.

Current: [X ms]
Target: [Y ms]

Bottleneck appears to be: [Identify issue]

Please optimize by:
1. [Optimization approach 1]
2. [Optimization approach 2]

Provide optimized code and new benchmarks.
```

   - ASSET_LAYER_DISCUSSION.md (context)

2. **Review examples**:
   - Look at existing similar code
   - Check test patterns
   - Review documentation style

3. **Simplify**:
   - Break task into smaller pieces
   - Implement minimal version first
   - Add features iteratively

## Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small
Begin with Task 1.1 (Event System). It's well-defined, has no dependencies, and teaches you the process.

### 2. Validate Often
Run tests after every significant change. Catch issues early.

### 3. Keep Context Fresh
Provide AI agents with recent code, not outdated examples.

### 4. Document As You Go
Don't wait until the end. Document while implementing.

### 5. Test Integration Early
Don't wait until all tasks are done. Test integration between tasks as they complete.

### 6. Celebrate Progress
Each completed task is a win! ðŸŽ‰
