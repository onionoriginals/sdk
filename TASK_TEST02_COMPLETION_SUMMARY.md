## Test-Driven Development Approach

These tests follow TDD principles:

1. **Tests as Specifications**: Tests define the expected behavior of the publish-to-web feature
2. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Tests are written first (currently failing), then implementation makes them pass
3. **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation of feature behavior

**Current State**: 🔴 **RED** - Tests written, implementation pending (TASK_BE02, TASK_FE02)

**Next State**: 🟢 **GREEN** - Once implementation is complete, tests should pass

---

## Validation Checklist

✅ **Completed**:
- [x] All backend API tests written
- [x] All frontend component tests written
- [x] All E2E integration tests written
- [x] Tests cover success paths
- [x] Tests cover error cases
- [x] Tests verify layer transitions
- [x] Tests verify DID resolution
- [x] Tests verify authorization
- [x] Comprehensive documentation created

⏳ **Pending** (requires implementation):
- [ ] Tests pass consistently
- [ ] Coverage goals met (>80%)
- [ ] No flaky tests

---

## Key Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. User creates asset (did:peer)
2. User clicks "Publish to Web"
3. User confirms in modal
4. Asset published to did:webvh
5. DID document becomes publicly resolvable
6. Provenance updated with migration event
7. UI shows success and new layer badge

### Error Paths
- Already published asset → 400 Bad Request
- Non-owned asset → 403 Forbidden
- Asset not found → 404 Not Found
- Unauthenticated request → 401 Unauthorized
- SDK errors → 500 Internal Server Error
- Network errors → Error toast displayed

### Edge Cases
- Concurrent publish requests
- Custom domain specification
- Asset data preservation
- Provenance chain integrity
- Layer badge updates
- Button state management

---

## Dependencies

### Test Dependencies
- **bun:test** - Test runner
- **@testing-library/react** - Component testing utilities
- **@tanstack/react-query** - Query client for data fetching
- **playwright** - Browser automation for E2E tests
- **express** - HTTP server for API tests
- **form-data** - Multipart form data handling

### Implementation Dependencies (Required for tests to pass)
- **Backend**: `/api/assets/:id/publish-to-web` endpoint (TASK_BE02)
- **Frontend**: Asset detail page with publish UI (TASK_FE02)
- **SDK**: `originalsSdk.lifecycle.publishToWeb()` (already exists)
- **Storage**: Layer tracking fields (didWebvh, currentLayer)

## API Contract (Tested)

### Request
```typescript
POST /api/assets/:id/publish-to-web
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
Body:
  {
    domain?: string  // Optional custom domain
  }
```

### Response (200 OK)
```typescript
{
  asset: {
    id: string
    title: string
    currentLayer: 'did:webvh'
    didPeer: string        // Original preserved
    didWebvh: string       // New DID
    provenance: {
      migrations: [
        {
          from: 'did:peer'
          to: 'did:webvh'
          timestamp: string
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  originalsAsset: {
    bindings: {
      'did:webvh': string
    }
  }
  resolverUrl: string      // Public DID resolver URL
}
```

### Error Responses
- `400` - Already published
- `401` - Unauthenticated
- `403` - Not authorized (not owner)
- `404` - Asset not found
- `500` - Server error

---

## UI Requirements (Tested)

### Asset Detail Page Requirements
1. **Layer Badge** (`[data-testid="layer-badge"]`)
   - Shows "Private" or "did:peer" for unpublished assets
   - Shows "Published" or "did:webvh" for published assets

2. **Publish Button** (`button:has-text("Publish to Web")`)
   - Visible only for did:peer assets
   - Hidden for did:webvh and did:btco assets
   - Hidden for non-owned assets
   - Disabled while publishing

3. **Confirmation Modal**
   - Shows warning about public accessibility
   - Explains DID resolution
   - Has Cancel and Publish buttons
   - Disables Publish button during operation

4. **Success State**
   - Shows success toast
   - Displays did:webvh identifier
   - Shows resolver URL link
   - Updates layer badge

5. **Error Handling**
   - Shows error toasts
   - Displays appropriate error messages
   - Maintains asset state on error

## Integration with Existing Tests

These tests complement existing test suites:

### Related Test Files
- `asset-creation.test.ts` - Tests asset creation with did:peer
- `asset-creation-flow.test.ts` - E2E tests for asset creation
- `CompleteLifecycle.e2e.test.ts` - SDK lifecycle tests (peer → webvh → btco)

### Test Helpers Used
- `createTestUser()` - Create test user with DID
- `createMockAuthToken()` - Generate auth token
- `createTestFile()` - Generate test files

## Success Criteria

✅ Task TEST-02 is **COMPLETE** when:

1. ✅ All tests written (Backend, Frontend, E2E)
2. ✅ Edge cases covered
3. ✅ Error scenarios tested
4. ✅ E2E flow documented
5. ✅ Tests are maintainable
6. ⏳ All tests pass (pending implementation)
7. ⏳ Test coverage adequate (pending implementation)

**Note**: Tests are complete as specifications. They will pass once TASK_BE02 and TASK_FE02 implementations are done.

---

## Next Steps

1. **TASK_BE02**: Implement `/api/assets/:id/publish-to-web` endpoint
2. **TASK_FE02**: Implement asset detail page with publish UI
3. **Run Tests**: Execute test suite to verify implementation
4. **Fix Failures**: Address any failing tests
5. **Verify Coverage**: Ensure >80% coverage
6. **CI/CD**: Integrate tests into pipeline

---

## Notes

- Tests follow existing patterns from asset-creation tests
- Mocking approach matches current test infrastructure
- E2E tests use Playwright like existing integration tests
- All test helpers are reusable across test suites
- Documentation provides clear guidance for running and troubleshooting
