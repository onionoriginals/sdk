# Test Coverage Improvements - Session Summary

## ðŸ“Š Overall Results

**Before**: 95.90% functions, 96.52% lines  
**After**: 95.90% functions, 96.86% lines  
**Improvement**: +0.34% line coverage

## âœ… Files Improved

### 1. Signer.ts - MAJOR IMPROVEMENT
**Before**: 80.00% functions, 79.90% lines  
**After**: 80.00% functions, 95.98% lines  
**Improvement**: +16.08% line coverage

**Changes made**:
- Added tests for error catch blocks in all signer classes (ES256KSigner, ES256Signer, Ed25519Signer, Bls12381G2Signer)
- Tested decode error paths when multikey decoding fails
- Added tests for module initialization utility functions
- Verified hmacSha256Sync and sha512Sync functions are callable

**New test cases added**:
```typescript
- ES256KSigner sign/verify catches decode error and wraps it
- Ed25519Signer sign/verify catches decode error and wraps it  
- ES256Signer sign/verify catches decode error and wraps it
- Bls12381G2Signer sign/verify catches decode error and wraps it
- Module initialization ensures utility functions exist
- Verifies hmacSha256Sync is callable
- Verifies ed25519 sha512Sync is callable
```

**Remaining uncovered** (inherently difficult):
- Lines 1-5: Abstract class definition (cannot instantiate)
- Lines 21-22: Conditional initialization (only runs if functions missing in environment)

### 2. Test Files Enhanced

**tests/unit/crypto/Signer.test.ts**:
- Added 8 new test cases for decode error wrapping
- Added 3 new test cases for module initialization
- Total new test cases: 11

## ðŸ“‹ Documentation Created

### 1. COVERAGE_STATUS.md
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Current status and target goals
- Detailed breakdown of all files needing coverage improvements
- Priority-ordered roadmap to reach 100% coverage
- Estimated effort for each phase (16-25 hours total)
- Technical notes on inherently difficult-to-cover code
- Progress tracking

### 2. SESSION_IMPROVEMENTS.md (this file)
Summary of work completed in this session

## ðŸŽ¯ Remaining Work for 100% Coverage

### Critical Gaps (in priority order):

1. **DIDManager.ts** (32.20% lines) - ~8-12 hours
   - Missing: createDIDWebVH, updateDIDWebVH, saveDIDLog
   - Requires mocking didwebvh-ts library and filesystem operations

2. **WebVHManager.ts** (64.56% lines) - ~4-6 hours
   - Missing: Lines 386-486
   - Requires similar mocking as DIDManager

3. **KeyManager.ts** (90.10% lines) - ~2-3 hours
   - Missing: Lines 13-14, 21, 32, 37-44, 56-62
   - Likely edge cases and error paths

4. **Function Coverage Gaps** - ~2-4 hours
   - Several files have 100% line coverage but <100% function coverage
   - Quick wins by adding direct function call tests

### Acceptable Gaps (Defensive Code):

- **Signer.ts** lines 1-5, 21-22: Abstract class + conditional initialization
- **satoshi-validation.ts** lines 64-67, 72-75, 80-83: Unreachable defensive checks

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements Made

1. **Better error coverage**: All Signer classes now test decode error paths
2. **Module initialization testing**: Verified crypto utility injection works  
3. **Comprehensive documentation**: Clear roadmap to 100% coverage
4. **Test infrastructure**: Enhanced test patterns for error handling

## ðŸ“ˆ Impact

- **Improved code reliability**: More error paths tested
- **Better documentation**: Clear path forward for team
- **Foundation for 100%**: Identified all gaps with specific solutions
- **Team productivity**: Documented effort estimates for planning

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Future Work

1. **Phase 1** (Quick wins - 2-4 hours):
   - Fix function coverage gaps in VC files
   - Test untested exported functions
   
2. **Phase 2** (Medium - 4-6 hours):
   - Complete KeyManager.ts
   - Complete WebVHManager.ts
   
3. **Phase 3** (Major - 8-12 hours):
   - Comprehensive DIDManager.ts testing
   - Integration tests with mocked dependencies

## âœ¨ Key Achievements

1. âœ… Significantly improved Signer.ts coverage (+16% lines)
2. âœ… Created comprehensive coverage roadmap  
3. âœ… Documented all remaining gaps with solutions
4. âœ… Established test patterns for similar improvements
5. âœ… Provided clear effort estimates for planning
