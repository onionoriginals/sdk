## 🎯 Quick Decision Tree

### Are you ready to implement NOW?
→ **YES**: Go to [Implementation Path](#-implementation-path-start-building-now) below  
→ **NO**: Go to [Discussion Path](#-discussion-path-strategic-planning) below

---

## 💼 Discussion Path (Strategic Planning)

**Use this if you need to discuss strategy, get buy-in, or make decisions first.**

### Step 1: Review Documents (30 minutes)
1. Read **DISCUSSION_SUMMARY.md** (10 min)
2. Skim **MIGRATION_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md** (10 min)
3. Note questions from **ASSET_MIGRATION_STATUS.md** (10 min)

### Step 2: Schedule Discussion (2 hours)
Use the discussion format from DISCUSSION_SUMMARY.md:

**Part 1: Strategic Alignment (30 min)**
- Review three-layer model (peer → webvh → btco)
- Discuss target users and use cases
- Prioritize features for MVP

**Part 2: Technical Decisions (45 min)**
Answer these 7 questions:
1. Storage strategy? (S3, IPFS, or hybrid)
2. Bitcoin provider? (Self-host Ord or use service)
3. Domain strategy? (Shared vs custom)
4. Fee payment model? (Direct vs prepaid credits)
5. Migration triggers? (Always manual or conditional)
6. Batch operations? (One-by-one or bulk)
7. Rollback capability? (Can users unpublish?)

**Part 3: Implementation Planning (30 min)**
- Review AI_AGENT_COORDINATION_PLAN.md
- Assign ownership
- Set milestones
- Identify blockers

**Part 4: Q&A (15 min)**

### Step 3: Make Decisions
Document answers to the 7 questions above. These will guide implementation.

### Step 4: Proceed to Implementation Path

## 🛠️ Implementation Path (Start Building Now)

**Use this if you're ready to execute with AI agents immediately.**

### Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] You have access to AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- [ ] You can run multiple agent "sessions" in parallel (or have multiple agents)
- [ ] You have ~60-80 hours of agent time available over 2-3 weeks
- [ ] Development environment is set up (database, SDK, etc.)

### Step 1: Assign Coordinator Agent (10 minutes)

Open your AI agent interface and paste this prompt:

```
You are the Coordinator Agent for the Originals Protocol asset migration implementation.

Read these files in order:
1. AI_AGENT_COORDINATION_PLAN.md
2. TASK_PROGRESS.yaml (you'll create this)

Your responsibilities:
- Track progress of all tasks
- Assign tasks to available agents
- Resolve blockers
- Ensure integration between components
- Verify completion criteria

First action: Create TASK_PROGRESS.yaml file with all tasks from the plan.

Format:
```yaml
start_date: 2025-10-04
target_completion: 2025-10-25
status: in_progress

phases:
  phase_1_foundation:
    status: pending
    tasks:
      DB-01:
        name: Database Schema Migration
        status: pending
        assignee: null
        priority: critical
        estimated_hours: 2
        dependencies: []
      # ... etc for all tasks
```

After creating the tracking file, report:
1. Total number of tasks
2. Tasks with no dependencies (can start immediately)
3. Suggested first assignments
4. Estimated total time

Ready? Create the tracking file now.
```

### Step 2: Start Phase 1 Foundation (Week 1)

**Assign these tasks to agents (can work in parallel):**

#### Agent 1: Database Migration (2 hours)
Use prompt from **QUICK_START_AGENT_PROMPTS.md** → "Task DB-01"

#### Agent 2: Backend Asset Creation (6 hours, after DB-01)
Use prompt from **QUICK_START_AGENT_PROMPTS.md** → "Task BE-01"

#### Agent 3: Frontend Asset Creation (4 hours, after BE-01)
Use prompt from **QUICK_START_AGENT_PROMPTS.md** → "Task FE-01"

#### Agent 4: Layer Badge UI (3 hours, parallel to Agent 2/3)
Use prompt from **QUICK_START_AGENT_PROMPTS.md** → "Task FE-02"

**Expected Outcome After Phase 1:**
- ✅ Assets created with proper `did:peer` identifiers
- ✅ DIDs displayed to users
- ✅ Layer tracking in database
- ✅ UI shows current layer with badges

### Step 3: Configure Infrastructure (Week 1-2, parallel track)

**Can start these in parallel while Phase 1 continues:**

#### Agent 5: S3 Storage Setup (4 hours)
Use prompt: **QUICK_START_AGENT_PROMPTS.md** → "Task INFRA-01"

#### Agent 6: Bitcoin Provider Setup (8 hours)
Use prompt: **QUICK_START_AGENT_PROMPTS.md** → "Task INFRA-02"

### Step 4: Web Publication (Week 2)

**After Phase 1 and INFRA-01 complete:**

#### Agent 2 (Backend): Publication Endpoint (4 hours)
Use prompt: **QUICK_START_AGENT_PROMPTS.md** → "Task BE-02"

#### Agent 3 (Frontend): Publication UI (5 hours)
Use prompt: **QUICK_START_AGENT_PROMPTS.md** → "Task FE-03"

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Users can publish assets to web layer
- ✅ Resources uploaded to S3
- ✅ Public URLs accessible

### Step 5: Bitcoin Inscription (Week 2)

**After INFRA-02 complete:**

#### Agent 2 (Backend): Inscription Endpoint (5 hours)
Use prompt: **QUICK_START_AGENT_PROMPTS.md** → "Task BE-03"

#### Agent 3 (Frontend): Inscription UI (6 hours)
Use prompt: **QUICK_START_AGENT_PROMPTS.md** → "Task FE-04"

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Users can inscribe assets on Bitcoin
- ✅ Fee estimation works
- ✅ Transaction tracking

### Step 6: Testing & Documentation (Week 3)

#### Testing Agent: Comprehensive Tests (6 hours)
Use prompt: **QUICK_START_AGENT_PROMPTS.md** → "Testing Agent Prompt"

#### Documentation Agent: All Docs (8 hours)
Use prompt: **QUICK_START_AGENT_PROMPTS.md** → "Documentation Agent Prompt"

#### Coordinator: Final Integration (8 hours)
Use prompt from **AI_AGENT_COORDINATION_PLAN.md** → "Task COORD-01"

## 🚨 When Things Go Wrong

### Agent Reports Blocker

**Coordinator actions:**

1. **Understand the blocker**
   ```
   Explain in detail:
   - What are you trying to do?
   - What error are you getting?
   - What have you tried?
   - What files are you working in?
   ```

2. **Check dependencies**
   - Is a prerequisite task incomplete?
   - Are required services running?
   - Are environment variables set?

3. **Try these solutions**
   - Read the referenced test files
   - Search codebase for similar patterns
   - Check existing working code
   - Consult AI_AGENT_COORDINATION_PLAN.md for context

4. **Escalate if needed**
   - Reassign task
   - Break into smaller tasks
   - Seek human assistance

### Common Issues & Fixes

**"SDK method not working"**
→ Read: `tests/integration/CompleteLifecycle.e2e.test.ts`
→ SDK is proven to work, likely a usage issue

**"Tests failing after my changes"**
→ Run tests individually to isolate
→ Check for TypeScript errors
→ Verify imports correct

**"Can't connect to database"**
→ Check connection string
→ Run migrations: `bun run drizzle-kit push`
→ Verify Postgres running

**"Frontend build errors"**
→ Run: `bun install`
→ Check for missing dependencies
→ Verify TypeScript types

## 📈 Estimated Timeline

### Aggressive (Full-time agents): 1-2 weeks
- 8 hours/day agent time
- 2-3 agents working in parallel
- Minimal blockers

### Standard (Part-time agents): 3-4 weeks
- 4 hours/day agent time
- 2 agents working in parallel
- Some discussion/review time

### Conservative (Learning mode): 4-6 weeks
- 2 hours/day agent time
- 1-2 agents
- Time for learning and iteration

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with Phase 1, don't jump ahead
2. **Test Often**: Run tests after each task completion
3. **Document As You Go**: Don't save documentation for the end
4. **Review Code**: Have agents review each other's code
5. **Stay Organized**: Keep TASK_PROGRESS.yaml updated

### Agent Management:

1. **Clear Prompts**: Use the provided prompts verbatim
2. **One Task**: Don't ask agent to do multiple tasks at once
3. **Verify Completion**: Check that success criteria are met
4. **Parallel Work**: Maximize agents working in parallel
5. **Communication**: Agents should report blockers immediately

### Quality Assurance:

1. **Test Everything**: Every endpoint, every component
2. **Manual Testing**: Actually use the UI, don't just trust tests
3. **Edge Cases**: Test error conditions, not just happy path
4. **Integration**: Verify components work together
5. **Documentation**: Ensure docs match implementation
