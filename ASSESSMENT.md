# Originals SDK v1.0 Assessment
## Product & Technical Architecture Review

**Date:** 2025-11-18 (Updated: 2025-11-18)
**Author:** Product Management & Technical Architecture
**Purpose:** Assess current SDK implementation against protocol vision for v1.0 specification

---

## Executive Summary

The Originals SDK implements a novel protocol for managing digital asset lifecycles across three decentralized identity (DID) layers: `did:peer` (private), `did:webvh` (web-hosted), and `did:btco` (Bitcoin-inscribed). The implementation demonstrates strong technical foundations with 90 TypeScript files, comprehensive cryptographic infrastructure, and a layered architecture.

**Current Status:**
- **Test Coverage:** ✅ 1136 passing tests (100% SDK pass rate) - DEPENDENCY ISSUES RESOLVED
- **Architecture Maturity:** Core managers and lifecycle flows implemented
- **DID Layer Support:** All three layers (peer, webvh, btco) operational
- **Bitcoin Integration:** Ordinals inscription and transfer capabilities present
- **Verifiable Credentials:** W3C-compliant VC implementation with multiple cryptosuites

**Update 2025-11-18:** Dependency issues resolved via `bun install`. Test pass rate improved from 84.7% → 100% for SDK package. See [DEPENDENCY_RESOLUTION.md](./DEPENDENCY_RESOLUTION.md) for details.

**Key Gaps for v1.0:**
1. ✅ Missing formal protocol specification → **ADDRESSED** in [SPEC_v1.0_DRAFT.md](./SPEC_v1.0_DRAFT.md)
2. ❌ Incomplete did:webvh documentation (DIDWEBVH_INTEGRATION.md referenced but not present)
3. ⚠️ Limited examples and developer onboarding materials
4. ⚠️ Migration flows need validation and hardening
5. ⚠️ Fee estimation and Bitcoin operations need production readiness review

---

## 1. Architecture Assessment

### 1.1 Core System Design

**Status:** ✅ **Well-Architected**

The SDK follows a clean separation of concerns with four primary managers orchestrated by `OriginalsSDK`:

```
OriginalsSDK (src/core/OriginalsSDK.ts)
├── DIDManager (src/did/DIDManager.ts)
│   ├── did:peer creation (offline)
│   ├── did:webvh migration (web hosting)
│   └── did:btco resolution (Bitcoin)
├── CredentialManager (src/vc/CredentialManager.ts)
│   ├── W3C VC issuance/verification
│   └── JSON-LD with Data Integrity proofs
├── LifecycleManager (src/lifecycle/LifecycleManager.ts)
│   ├── Asset creation
│   ├── Layer migration
│   └── Event-driven architecture
└── BitcoinManager (src/bitcoin/BitcoinManager.ts)
    ├── Inscription creation
    └── Transfer operations
```

**Strengths:**
- Clear manager separation with well-defined responsibilities
- Event-driven architecture for lifecycle tracking
- Pluggable adapters (storage, fee oracle, ordinals provider)
- Support for external signers (Turnkey, AWS KMS, HSMs)

**Concerns:**
- Some circular dependencies between managers (mitigated by dependency injection)
- Bitcoin operations tightly coupled to OrdinalsProvider interface

### 1.2 Three-Layer DID Architecture

**Status:** ✅ **Implemented** | ⚠️ **Documentation Gaps**

| Layer | DID Method | Status | Implementation | Documentation |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Private** | `did:peer` | ✅ Complete | `@aviarytech/did-peer` integration | Good |
| **Web** | `did:webvh` | ✅ Complete | `didwebvh-ts` v2.5.5 integration | **Missing** |
| **Bitcoin** | `did:btco` | ✅ Complete | Custom resolver + inscriptions | Good |

**did:peer Layer:**
- Uses Peer DID spec (variant 4 - long-form)
- Multikey verification methods
- Offline creation (no blockchain dependency)
- Returns full DID Document with authentication/assertion methods

**did:webvh Layer:**
- Web-hosted DID with version history (JSONL logs)
- External signer support for production deployments
- HTTPS resolution via `.well-known/did.jsonl`
- **CRITICAL:** Referenced `DIDWEBVH_INTEGRATION.md` documentation is missing

**did:btco Layer:**
- Bitcoin Ordinals-based DIDs
- Satoshi-number addressing: `did:btco:<satoshi_number>`
- DID document inscribed as ordinal
- Resolution via BtcoDidResolver + OrdinalsProvider
- Ownership transfer = DID document update on-chain

**Migration Path:**
```
did:peer → did:webvh → did:btco
(offline)   (HTTPS)     (Bitcoin)
  FREE       ~$25/yr     $75-200 one-time
```

### 1.3 Bitcoin & Ordinals Integration

**Status:** ✅ **Functional** | ⚠️ **Production Readiness TBD**

**Implementation Features:**
- ✅ Commit-reveal inscription pattern (front-running protection)
- ✅ UTXO selection with ordinal-awareness
- ✅ Resource-aware UTXO selection (avoid spending inscriptions)
- ✅ PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction) building
- ✅ Mock provider for testing (`OrdMockProvider`)
- ✅ Fee estimation and dynamic fee oracle support
- ✅ Multi-network support (mainnet, testnet, signet, regtest)

**Architecture:**
```typescript
BitcoinManager
├── inscribeData() → Commit-reveal inscription
├── transferInscription() → Move inscription to new address
├── inscribeDID() → Create did:btco
└── transferDID() → Transfer did:btco ownership

OrdinalsProvider (interface)
├── OrdMockProvider → Testing/development
└── OrdinalsClient → Production (connects to ord API/daemon)
```

**Concerns for Production:**
1. Fee estimation accuracy under varying mempool conditions
2. UTXO selection optimization for large wallets
3. Error handling for Bitcoin network disruptions
4. Transaction broadcast retry logic
5. Confirmation monitoring and finality guarantees

### 1.4 Verifiable Credentials System

**Status:** ✅ **W3C Compliant**

**Implementation:**
- W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0
- JSON-LD format (not JWT)
- Data Integrity proofs (not JWS)
- Custom document loader for JSON-LD contexts

**Supported Cryptosuites:**
- ✅ EdDSA (Ed25519) signatures - `eddsa.ts`
- ✅ BBS+ signatures (selective disclosure) - `bbs.ts`
- ⚠️ BBS Simple variant - `bbsSimple.ts` (status unclear)

**Integration:**
- Credentials issued against DID subjects
- DID resolution for issuer/subject verification
- Provenance tracking via credential chains

### 1.5 Storage & Persistence

**Status:** ✅ **Abstracted** | ⚠️ **Limited Implementations**

**Current Adapters:**
- `MemoryStorageAdapter` - In-memory (testing only)
- `LocalStorageAdapter` - Browser localStorage
- **Missing:** Database adapters (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- **Missing:** Distributed storage (IPFS, Arweave, etc.)

**Interface Design:**
```typescript
interface StorageAdapter {
  get(key: string): Promise<any>;
  set(key: string, value: any): Promise<void>;
  delete(key: string): Promise<void>;
  list(prefix?: string): Promise<string[]>;
}
```

### 1.6 Migration & State Management

**Status:** ✅ **Implemented** | ⚠️ **Validation Needed**

**Components:**
- `StateMachine` - Enforces lifecycle rules and valid transitions
- `ValidationPipeline` - Pre-flight checks before migration
- `CheckpointManager` - Recovery points for rollback
- `RollbackManager` - Revert failed migrations

**Validators:**
- `DIDCompatibilityValidator` - DID method compatibility checks
- `CredentialValidator` - VC integrity validation
- `StorageValidator` - Storage requirements verification
- `LifecycleValidator` - Layer progression enforcement

**Gaps:**
- Limited test coverage for complex migration scenarios
- Rollback testing appears incomplete
- No end-to-end migration flow validation tests visible

## 3. Protocol Vision vs. Implementation

### 3.1 Core Protocol Principles

Based on README and codebase analysis:

| Principle | Vision | Implementation Status |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Three-layer progression** | did:peer → did:webvh → did:btco | ✅ Fully implemented |
| **Unidirectional migration** | Cannot downgrade layers | ✅ Enforced by state machine |
| **Economic gravity** | Cost-based layer selection | ✅ Documented costs |
| **Cryptographic provenance** | Verifiable asset history | ✅ VC chains + DID resolution |
| **Decentralized identity** | W3C DID compliance | ✅ All three DID methods |
| **Offline-first** | did:peer works offline | ✅ No network required |
| **Web discovery** | HTTPS-based did:webvh | ✅ didwebvh-ts integration |
| **Bitcoin finality** | Immutable ownership on BTC | ✅ Ordinals inscriptions |

### 3.2 Use Case Alignment

**Documented Use Cases** (from README):

1. **Digital Art**
   - Create privately → Publish for discovery → Inscribe on sale
   - **Status:** ✅ Fully supported via lifecycle API

2. **Scientific Data**
   - Private datasets → Public peer review → Permanent provenance
   - **Status:** ✅ Supported, but missing scientific metadata standards

3. **DAO Governance**
   - Private credentials → Public recognition → Immutable decisions
   - **Status:** ⚠️ Credential system ready, DAO-specific workflows not implemented

4. **Supply Chain**
   - Product credentials → Public registries → Anti-counterfeiting
   - **Status:** ⚠️ Basic support, missing supply chain schema/ontology

**Assessment:** Core use cases (digital art, provenance) well-supported. Domain-specific use cases need application-layer development.

### 3.3 Developer Experience

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Simple SDK initialization: `OriginalsSDK.create(config)`
- ✅ Intuitive lifecycle API: `createAsset()` → `publishToWeb()` → `inscribeOnBitcoin()`
- ✅ Strong TypeScript typing throughout
- ✅ Good inline documentation (JSDoc comments)

**Gaps:**
- ⚠️ Limited examples (only 2 basic examples)
- ⚠️ Missing did:webvh integration guide
- ⚠️ No tutorials for advanced scenarios
- ⚠️ Bitcoin provider setup requires external documentation
