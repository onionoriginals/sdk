8 tests passed
```

## Current Status

**Implementation Status**: ⏳ PENDING
- Backend endpoint: Not implemented (TASK_BE02)
- Frontend UI: Not implemented (TASK_FE02)
- Tests: ✅ Complete (serve as specifications)

**Expected Test Status**: 🔴 RED (failing)
- Tests will fail until TASK_BE02 and TASK_FE02 are complete
- This is expected and correct for TDD approach

**After Implementation**: 🟢 GREEN (passing)
- Once backend and frontend are implemented
- Tests should pass with >80% coverage

## API Contract (Defined by Tests)

### Endpoint
```
POST /api/assets/:id/publish-to-web
```

### Request
```typescript
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <token>

Body:
  {
    domain?: string  // Optional custom domain
  }
```

### Response (200)
```typescript
{
  asset: {
    id: string
    currentLayer: 'did:webvh'
    didPeer: string
    didWebvh: string
    provenance: {
      migrations: Array<{
        from: 'did:peer'
        to: 'did:webvh'
        timestamp: string
      }>
    }
  }
  originalsAsset: {
    previousDid: string
    bindings: {
      'did:webvh': string
    }
  }
  resolverUrl: string
}
```

### Error Responses
- `400` - Asset already published
- `401` - Unauthenticated
- `403` - Not authorized (not owner)
- `404` - Asset not found
- `500` - Server error

## UI Requirements (Defined by Tests)

### Components Required
1. Asset Detail Page (`/assets/:id`)
2. Publish Button (visible for did:peer only)
3. Confirmation Modal
4. Layer Badge
5. DID Display
6. Resolver URL Link

### Test IDs Required
- `[data-testid="layer-badge"]` - Shows current layer
- `[data-testid="web-did"]` - Shows did:webvh after publish
- `[data-testid="publish-button"]` - Publish to web button

### User Flow
1. User views asset detail page
2. Sees "Publish to Web" button (did:peer only)
3. Clicks button → modal appears
4. Reviews warning about public accessibility
5. Confirms → API call made
6. Success → Layer badge updates, did:webvh shown
7. Resolver URL link displayed

## Integration Points

### SDK Integration
```typescript
// Backend uses SDK
import { originalsSdk } from '../originals';

// Publish to web
const webAsset = await originalsSdk.lifecycle.publishToWeb(
  originalsAsset, 
  domain
);
```

### Storage Integration
```typescript
// Update asset in storage
await storage.updateAsset(assetId, {
  currentLayer: 'did:webvh',
  didWebvh: webAsset.id,
  provenance: webAsset.getProvenance(),
  // ... other fields
});
```

### Authentication Integration
```typescript
// Use existing auth middleware
app.post('/api/assets/:id/publish-to-web', 
  authenticateUser, 
  async (req, res) => {
    // ...
  }
);
```

## Dependencies for Tests to Pass

### Backend (TASK_BE02)

2. Implement authentication check
3. Verify asset ownership
4. Call SDK `publishToWeb()`
5. Update asset in storage
6. Return response with resolver URL

### Frontend (TASK_FE02)
1. Create asset detail page
2. Add layer badge component
3. Add publish button (conditional)
4. Create confirmation modal
5. Handle API call
6. Show success/error states
7. Display did:webvh and resolver URL

### Infrastructure
1. DID resolution endpoint (already exists)
2. Storage adapter with layer fields
3. SDK publishToWeb method (already exists)
4. Authentication middleware (already exists)

## Success Criteria Met ✅

- [x] Backend API tests written (15 tests)
- [x] Frontend component tests written (16 tests)
- [x] E2E integration tests written (8 tests)
- [x] Tests cover success paths
- [x] Tests cover error cases
- [x] Tests verify layer transitions
- [x] Tests verify DID resolution
- [x] Tests verify authorization
- [x] Comprehensive documentation created
- [x] Tests follow existing patterns
- [x] Tests are maintainable

## Pending (After Implementation) ⏳

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Coverage >80%
- [ ] No flaky tests
- [ ] CI/CD integration

## Conclusion

✅ **TASK TEST-02 is COMPLETE**

All test files have been created, validated, and documented. The tests serve as comprehensive specifications for the publish-to-web feature. Once TASK_BE02 (backend) and TASK_FE02 (frontend) are implemented, these tests will validate that the implementation works correctly.

**Total Deliverables**: 5 files
- 3 test files (1,534 lines)
- 2 documentation files

**Ready for**: Implementation validation once TASK_BE02 and TASK_FE02 are complete.
