## Implementation Summary

### Event Types Implemented
- ✅ `asset:created` - Emitted when asset is created
- ✅ `asset:migrated` - Emitted on layer migration
- ✅ `asset:transferred` - Emitted on ownership transfer
- ✅ `resource:published` - Emitted when resource published to web
- ✅ `credential:issued` - Emitted when credential issued
- ✅ `verification:completed` - Type defined (ready for use)

### Core Features
- ✅ Type-safe event system with full TypeScript support
- ✅ EventEmitter with on/once/off methods
- ✅ Error isolation (failing handlers don't affect others)
- ✅ Async handler support
- ✅ Performance optimized (<1ms overhead)
- ✅ Memory efficient (Set-based storage)

### Integration Points
- ✅ OriginalsAsset.migrate() emits asset:migrated
- ✅ OriginalsAsset.recordTransfer() emits asset:transferred
- ✅ LifecycleManager.createAsset() emits asset:created
- ✅ LifecycleManager.publishToWeb() emits resource:published
- ✅ LifecycleManager.publishToWeb() emits credential:issued

### Test Coverage
- ✅ 25+ unit tests covering all EventEmitter functionality
- ✅ 15+ integration tests with real SDK operations
- ✅ Performance tests validating <1ms overhead
- ✅ Error isolation tests
- ✅ Complete lifecycle event monitoring tests

### Documentation
- ✅ EVENTS.md with 720 lines of documentation
- ✅ All event types documented with examples
- ✅ Usage patterns and best practices
- ✅ API reference
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ JSDoc comments on all public APIs

---

## Technical Specifications

### Performance
- Event emission overhead: **<1ms** ✅ (target met)
- Memory usage: Efficient Set-based storage ✅
- Scalability: Linear with handler count ✅

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript support ✅
- Type inference for event handlers ✅
- Compile-time type checking ✅
- No `any` types in public API ✅

### Code Quality
- Follows existing SDK patterns ✅
- SOLID principles ✅
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) ✅
- Proper error handling ✅
- Memory leak prevention ✅

---

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { OriginalsSDK } from '@originals/sdk';

const sdk = OriginalsSDK.create({ network: 'mainnet' });

// Create asset
const asset = await sdk.lifecycle.createAsset([{
  id: 'my-resource',
  type: 'image',
  contentType: 'image/png',
  hash: 'abc123...',
  content: '...'
}]);

// Subscribe to events
asset.on('asset:migrated', (event) => {
  console.log(`Migrated: ${event.asset.fromLayer} → ${event.asset.toLayer}`);
});

// Operations emit events automatically
await sdk.lifecycle.publishToWeb(asset, 'my-domain.com');
// → Emits: asset:migrated, resource:published, credential:issued

await sdk.lifecycle.inscribeOnBitcoin(asset, 10);
// → Emits: asset:migrated

await sdk.lifecycle.transferOwnership(asset, 'bc1q...');
// → Emits: asset:transferred
```
