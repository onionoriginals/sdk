## Security Findings Summary

### Medium Priority Issues (4)

1. **Race Condition Risk in Concurrent Batch Operations**
   - Location: `src/lifecycle/LifecycleManager.ts:814-995`
   - Impact: Potential UTXO double-selection
   - Status: MITIGATED by OrdinalsProvider, needs hardening
   - Recommendation: Implement UTXO locking mechanism

2. **Fee Rate Boundary Validation Needs Upper Limit**
   - Location: `src/bitcoin/BitcoinManager.ts:87-89`
   - Impact: Potential fund drainage via excessive fees
   - Status: NEEDS REMEDIATION
   - Recommendation: Add MAX_REASONABLE_FEE_RATE = 10,000 sat/vB

3. **Batch Operation Timeout May Leave Partial State**
   - Location: `src/lifecycle/BatchOperations.ts:232-241`
   - Impact: Orphaned pending transactions
   - Status: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
   - Recommendation: Track operations after timeout

4. **Missing UTXO Lock Check in Selection**
   - Location: `src/bitcoin/utxo-selection.ts:138-157`
   - Impact: Attempting to spend locked UTXOs
   - Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
   - Recommendation: Standardize lock checking across all selection functions

### Low Priority Issues (3)

5. **Potential Integer Overflow in Large Batch Fee Calculations**
   - Recommendation: Use BigInt for large calculations

6. **Domain Validation Could Be Stricter**
   - Recommendation: Validate IP address octets (0-255 range)

7. **SQL Injection Safe but Missing Input Size Limits**
   - Recommendation: Add JSONB size constraints

## Testing Coverage

### Penetration Tests (50+ scenarios)

**Attack Vectors Tested:**
1. Double-spend attempts
2. Fee rate manipulation (negative, NaN, Infinity, extreme values)
3. Malicious Bitcoin addresses (XSS, SQL injection, path traversal)
4. Malicious satoshi numbers (overflow, scientific notation, hex)
5. Malicious MIME types (injection attempts, oversized)
6. UTXO selection edge cases (insufficient funds, empty lists, dust)
7. Integer overflow scenarios
8. Concurrent operation race conditions
9. Malformed DID identifiers
10. Boundary value testing
11. Error information leakage
12. Resource exhaustion

**Expected Results:**
- All malicious inputs rejected ✅

## Recommendations Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Before Production) ⚠️

1. **Add fee rate upper bounds**
   ```typescript
   const MAX_REASONABLE_FEE_RATE = 10_000; // sat/vB
   if (feeRate > MAX_REASONABLE_FEE_RATE) {
     throw new StructuredError('INVALID_INPUT',
       `Fee rate ${feeRate} exceeds maximum ${MAX_REASONABLE_FEE_RATE}`);
   }
   ```

2. **Implement UTXO locking mechanism**
   ```typescript
   private utxoLocks = new Map<string, Promise<any>>();

   private async lockUtxo(utxoId: string): Promise<() => void> {
     // Lock management implementation
   }
   ```

3. **Improve timeout handling**
   - Track pending operations after timeout
   - Provide status callbacks for long-running ops

### Short-term (Next Sprint) 📅

4. **Standardize UTXO lock checking**
   - Ensure all selection functions check `locked` property
   - Consistent behavior across `selectUtxos` and `selectResourceUtxos`

5. **Add batch operation monitoring**
   - Success rate metrics
   - Performance metrics
   - Error rate tracking

6. **Document retry behavior**
   - Expected behavior for failed batches
   - Recovery procedures

### Long-term (Future Enhancements) 🔮

7. **Add JSONB size constraints**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE assets ADD CONSTRAINT check_provenance_size
     CHECK (pg_column_size(provenance) < 1048576);
   ```

8. **Improve domain validation**
   - Strict IP address validation (0-255 octets)
   - Punycode domain support

9. **Consider BigInt for fee calculations**
   - Handle edge cases with very large batches
   - Prevent precision loss
