# Ralph Progress Log
Project: Originals CEL
Branch: feature/originals-cel
Started: 2026-01-20

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Add reusable patterns here as you discover them -->
- SDK source is in packages/sdk/src/
- Explorer source is in explorer/src/
- Use @noble/* for crypto primitives
- Run `bun run typecheck` in sdk root to check types
- Convex functions go in explorer/convex/

## US-001 - Create CEL types.ts with data model interfaces
Completed: 2026-01-20T09:15:00Z
Agent: Cursor Chat

### Changes
- packages/sdk/src/cel/types.ts: Created CEL data model interfaces
  - DataIntegrityProof: W3C Data Integrity proof structure
  - WitnessProof: Extended proof with witnessedAt timestamp
  - ExternalReference: For large resources (url[], mediaType, digestMultibase)
  - LogEntry: Single event with type, data, previousEvent, proof[]
  - EventLog: Complete log with events[] and optional previousLog
  - VerificationResult, EventVerification: For verify results
  - CreateOptions, UpdateOptions, DeactivateOptions, VerifyOptions
  - AssetState: Derived state from replaying events
- packages/sdk/src/cel/index.ts: Export barrel file

### Learnings
- Existing Proof interface in types/credentials.ts is simpler than CEL's DataIntegrityProof
- CEL proofs need cryptosuite field which existing Proof lacks
- Typecheck runs with ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
