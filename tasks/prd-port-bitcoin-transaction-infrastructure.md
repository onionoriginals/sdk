# PRD: Port Bitcoin Transaction Infrastructure from Legacy

**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Immediate Priority  
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks  
**Team:** 1 engineer + AI assistance  
**Created:** October 14, 2025

---

## Introduction/Overview

The current Originals SDK lacks the core Bitcoin transaction infrastructure needed to properly inscribe Ordinals on Bitcoin. While the SDK has a high-level `BitcoinManager` and basic PSBT builder (~400 lines), it is missing the production-proven commit/reveal transaction logic that exists in the legacy codebase (~42,000 lines).

**The Problem:** 
- SDK cannot properly create commit transactions for Ordinals inscriptions
- SDK lacks reveal transaction logic for completing inscriptions
- Current UTXO selection is too simple and risks destroying inscriptions
- No transaction broadcasting with retry logic
- No confirmation tracking

**The Solution:**
Port the working, production-proven transaction infrastructure from `legacy/ordinalsplus/packages/ordinalsplus/src/transactions/` directly into the current SDK. This code has been battle-tested in the ordinalsplus explorer and works reliably.

**Why Direct Port (Not Rewrite):**
The legacy transaction code was hard-won after significant struggles. It works in production. Rewriting from scratch would risk re-introducing bugs and edge cases that have already been solved.

---

## Goals

1. **Enable proper Bitcoin inscription** - SDK can inscribe Ordinals on signet and mainnet
2. **Protect inscriptions** - Advanced UTXO selection prevents accidental destruction of existing inscriptions
3. **Production reliability** - Transaction broadcasting with retry logic and confirmation tracking
4. **Maintain compatibility** - Keep existing `BitcoinManager` API surface where possible
5. **Speed to market** - Complete in 2-4 weeks by direct porting (not rewriting)

---

## User Stories

### As a Developer
**Story 1:** Inscribe on Signet
```
As a developer using the Originals SDK,
I want to inscribe Ordinals on Bitcoin signet,
So that I can test inscription functionality before mainnet deployment.
```

**Story 2:** Inscribe on Mainnet
```
As a developer deploying to production,
I want to inscribe Ordinals on Bitcoin mainnet,
So that I can create permanent, verifiable digital assets for my users.
```

**Story 3:** Batch Inscriptions
```
As a developer working with multiple assets,
I want to batch inscribe multiple Ordinals in a single commit,
So that I can save on transaction fees and improve efficiency.
```

**Story 4:** Safe UTXO Selection
```
As a developer managing a wallet with inscriptions,
I want the SDK to never use inscription-bearing UTXOs as inputs,
So that I don't accidentally destroy existing inscriptions.
```

**Story 5:** Transaction Tracking
```
As a developer waiting for inscription confirmation,
I want to track transaction status and confirmations,
So that I know when my inscription is finalized on-chain.
```

### Explicitly NOT Included in This PRD:

‚ùå **Indexer Infrastructure** - Keep in legacy as separate service, do not port to SDK

‚ùå **Explorer App Code** - Keep as reference only, do not port to SDK

‚ùå **Advanced VC Features** - Selective disclosure (BBS+) not needed for transaction porting

‚ùå **VC v1.x Full Support** - Focus on transaction logic first, VC improvements separate PRD

‚ùå **JWE Encryption** - Not needed for basic inscription functionality

‚ùå **Transaction Status Tracker** - Advanced status tracking can be follow-up PRD

‚ùå **Satpoint-Specific Inscription** - `inscribe-with-satpoint.ts` is advanced feature, defer

‚ùå **Resource Creation Helpers** - `resource-creation.ts` is helper, not core requirement

‚ùå **API Changes** - Do not change existing `BitcoinManager` API surface unless absolutely necessary

‚ùå **New Dependencies** - Use existing dependencies where possible, minimize additions

### Dependencies

**Current SDK Dependencies (Already Available):**
- `bitcoinjs-lib` - Bitcoin transaction construction ‚úÖ
- `@noble/secp256k1` - Cryptography ‚úÖ
- `@scure/base` - Base encoding ‚úÖ

**May Need to Add:**
- `@bitcoinerlab/secp256k1` - For taproot operations (check if already covered)
- `tiny-secp256k1` - Bitcoin signature operations (check if already covered)

**Check Legacy Dependencies:**
Review `legacy/ordinalsplus/package.json` for any critical dependencies not in current SDK

### Type Compatibility

**Legacy Types to Port:**
- `ResourceUtxo` (with `hasResource` flag)
- `UtxoSelectionOptions`
- `CommitTransactionParams`
- `RevealTransactionParams`
- `InscriptionResult`

**Destination:** `src/types/bitcoin.ts` (already exists, extend it)

### Network Configuration

**Support Required:**
- Mainnet (`did:btco:`)
- Testnet (`did:btco:test:`) - Optional
- Signet (`did:btco:sig:`)

**Configuration Source:** `OriginalsConfig.network`

**Ord Node URLs:**
- Mainnet: `MAINNET_ORD_NODE_URL` env var
- Signet: `SIGNET_ORD_NODE_URL` env var

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests Required:**
1. UTXO selection algorithm tests
   - Test minimize_change strategy
   - Test minimize_inputs strategy
   - Test resource-aware selection (never use inscription UTXOs)
   - Test dust handling
   - Test locked UTXO handling

2. Fee calculation tests
   - Test various input/output combinations
   - Test different fee rates
   - Test edge cases (dust, single output)

3. Commit transaction tests
   - Test P2TR address generation
   - Test fee calculation
   - Test PSBT construction

4. Reveal transaction tests
   - Test inscription encoding
   - Test various content types
   - Test satoshi targeting

**Integration Tests Required:**
1. End-to-end inscription on signet
   - Create commit tx
   - Broadcast commit
   - Wait for confirmation
   - Create reveal tx
   - Broadcast reveal
   - Verify inscription

2. Batch inscription test on signet

**Manual Testing Required:**
1. Inscription on mainnet (small test inscription)
2. Verify inscription appears in explorers (ordiscan.com, ordinals.com)

### Migration Path

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing `BitcoinManager.inscribeData()` API MUST work unchanged
- Existing tests MUST pass
- New features are internal implementation details

**Feature Flag (Optional):**
```typescript
// In OriginalsConfig
interface OriginalsConfig {
  useLegacyTransactionLogic?: boolean; // Default: false (use new)
}
```

This allows gradual rollout and rollback if issues found.

## Open Questions

### Questions for Engineering

**Q1:** Should we add a feature flag for gradual rollout?
- **Suggestion:** Yes - `useLegacyTransactionLogic` config option
- **Default:** false (use new code)
- **Allows:** Rollback if issues found in production

**Q2:** What's the priority order if we can't finish everything in 4 weeks?
- **Must Have:** commit, reveal, UTXO selection, broadcasting
- **Nice to Have:** confirmation tracking, batch support
- **Can Defer:** Advanced features, optimization

**Q3:** How should we handle environment variables for Ord node URLs?
- **Option A:** Same as legacy (`MAINNET_ORD_NODE_URL`, `SIGNET_ORD_NODE_URL`)
- **Option B:** New config in `OriginalsConfig`
- **Recommendation:** Option A for consistency with explorer

**Q4:** Should we vendor the legacy code or import it as a dependency?
- **Recommendation:** Direct port (copy files) because:

  - We want to adapt types to SDK conventions
  - We want full control over the code

**Q5:** What's the testing budget for mainnet inscriptions?
- Mainnet inscription costs ~$20-100 depending on fee rates
- Recommend budget for 3-5 test inscriptions (~$100-500)
- Can use small/cheap inscriptions (text only, minimal bytes)

### Questions for Product

**Q6:** After this is complete, what's next priority?
- Port Ordiscan provider for faster resolution?
- Port VC version-aware wrapper?
- Security audit of transaction code?

**Q7:** Is there a hard deadline for this feature?

    network: 'mainnet',
    apiUrl: process.env.MAINNET_ORD_NODE_URL,
    walletPrivateKey: process.env.BITCOIN_PRIVATE_KEY
  })
});

const inscription = await sdk.bitcoin.inscribeData(
  Buffer.from('Hello, Ordinals!'),
  'text/plain',
  10 // 10 sat/vB
);

console.log('Inscription ID:', inscription.inscriptionId);
console.log('Transaction ID:', inscription.txid);
