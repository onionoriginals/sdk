---

## Least Valuable Code (Low ROI)

### 1. ⚠️ Legacy Code (CORRECTED ASSESSMENT)
**Location:** `legacy/` directory  
**Files:** 492 files (382 .ts/.tsx files = 75,596 lines)  
**CORRECTION:** Initial assessment was **WRONG** - this is NOT dead code!

**What Legacy Actually Contains:**
- ✅ **Production-proven transaction logic** (~42K lines) - **CRITICAL VALUE**
- ✅ **Advanced UTXO selection** (~10K lines) - **HIGH VALUE**
- ✅ **VC v1/v2 implementations** (~4K lines) - **HIGH VALUE**
- ✅ **Resource provider ecosystem** (~1.5K lines) - **HIGH VALUE**
- ⚠️ **Some truly legacy code** (indexer, explorer examples) - Low value for SDK

**Actual Recommendation:** 
- ✅ **DO NOT ARCHIVE** - Contains critical missing functionality
- ✅ **EVALUATE FOR MIGRATION** - See LEGACY_CODE_ANALYSIS.md
- ✅ **PORT CRITICAL COMPONENTS** (~45K lines of valuable code)
- ⚠️ **Only archive** indexer and explorer-specific code

**Estimated Value:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **EXTREMELY HIGH** (corrected from "Negative")

### 2. ⚠️ Over-Defensive Validation (Marginal Value)
**Location:** `src/utils/satoshi-validation.ts` (lines 64-83)  
**Why Low Value:**
- Unreachable defensive code given current regex validation
- Tests confirm these paths are never hit (87.50% coverage)
- Adds complexity without benefit

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Lines 64-67, 72-75, 80-83 - unreachable given regex
if (!parsed.network) {
  return { valid: false, error: 'Missing network prefix' };
}
```

**Recommendation:** Remove unreachable defensive checks or document why they're kept

### 3. ⚠️ Redundant Documentation Files (Low Value)
**Files:** Multiple overlapping docs
- `AI_AGENT_BUILD_PLAN.md` (23KB)
- `AI_AGENT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` (likely large)
- `AI_AGENT_QUICKSTART.md`
- `AI_BUILD_SUMMARY.md` (560 lines)
- `ASSET_LAYER_DISCUSSION.md`
- `ASSET_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `ASSET_LAYER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

**Why Low Value:**
- Significant overlap in content
- AI-specific docs should be in separate directory
- Confuses end users vs. developers vs. AI agents

**Recommendation:** Consolidate to user docs vs. contributor docs

### 4. ⚠️ Test Boilerplate (Low Value)
**Location:** Multiple test files with similar setup  
**Why Low Value:**
- Repeated mock setup across test files
- Could be abstracted to test utilities
- Makes tests harder to maintain

**Example:** Common pattern across files:
```typescript
const resources = [{
  id: 'res1',
  type: 'text',
  content: 'hello world',
  contentType: 'text/plain',
  hash: 'deadbeef'
}];
```

**Recommendation:** Create shared test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`

### 5. ⚠️ Unused Type Definitions (Low Value)
**Location:** `src/types/external-shims.d.ts`  
**Why Low Value:**
- May contain unused type definitions
- Not clear which are actively used
- Could bloat TypeScript compilation

**Recommendation:** Audit and remove unused types

### 6. ⚠️ Explorer App Tests in SDK Repo (Questionable Value)
**Location:** `apps/originals-explorer/`  
**Why Low Value:**
- SDK repo contains full application code
- Mixing library and application concerns
- Should likely be separate repository

**Recommendation:** Consider monorepo structure or separate repos

## AI-Generated Code Analysis

### Evidence of AI Generation

#### Strong Indicators (90%+ confidence AI-written)
1. **Commit Attribution:** 215/378 commits (57%) by "Cursor Agent"
2. **AI Planning Documents:** Explicit AI_AGENT_* documentation files
3. **Consistent Patterns:**
   - Extensive inline documentation comments
   - Comprehensive JSDoc for every method
   - Very consistent error handling patterns
   - Complete TypeScript type coverage
   - Systematic naming conventions (e.g., all events use `type: 'event:name'`)

#### Code Patterns Suggesting AI Authorship

**Pattern 1: Over-Documented Simple Functions**
```typescript
/**
 * Calculate retry delay with exponential backoff
 */
private calculateRetryDelay(attempt: number, baseDelay: number): number {
  // Exponential backoff: baseDelay * 2^attempt
  return baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt);
}
```
*Analysis:* This is a one-line mathematical function that doesn't need extensive docs.

**Pattern 2: Excessive Validation**
```typescript
// Input validation
if (!asset || typeof asset !== 'object') {
  throw new Error('Invalid asset: must be a valid OriginalsAsset');
}
if (feeRate !== undefined) {
  if (typeof feeRate !== 'number' || feeRate <= 0 || !Number.isFinite(feeRate)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid feeRate: must be a positive number');
  }
  if (feeRate < 1 || feeRate > 1000000) {
    throw new Error('Invalid feeRate: must be between 1 and 1000000 sat/vB');
  }
}
```
*Analysis:* Very thorough validation typical of AI-generated code. Human developers often trust TypeScript's type system more.

**Pattern 3: Complete Error Coverage**
Every function has try-catch with structured errors:
```typescript
try {
  // operation
  stopTimer();
  this.logger.info('Success');
  this.metrics.recordSuccess();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  stopTimer();
  this.logger.error('Failed', error as Error);
  this.metrics.recordError('ERROR_CODE', 'operation');
  throw error;
}
```
*Analysis:* Systematic error handling, logging, and metrics collection - very consistent, likely AI-generated template.

**Pattern 4: Extensive Documentation**
- TELEMETRY.md: 950 lines
- EVENTS.md: 753 lines
- AI_BUILD_SUMMARY.md: 560 lines

*Analysis:* Documentation is extremely thorough, well-structured, with multiple examples. Typical of AI generation with good prompts.

### Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Code

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Very consistent style and patterns
